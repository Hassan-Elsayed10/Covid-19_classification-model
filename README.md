# Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
### Utilized deep learning techniques to improve model accuracy and effectively classify images as pneumonia or healthy.
### Leveraged popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for model implementation and training.
